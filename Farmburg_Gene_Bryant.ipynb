We're not sure how much to charge for it, so we tested three different price points: \\$0.99, \\$1.99, and \\$4.99.  It looks like significantly more people bought the upgrade package for \\$0.99, so I guess that's what we'll charge.\n",

It's true that more people wanted purchase the upgrade at \\$0.99; you probably expected that.  What we really want to know is if each price point allows us to make enough money that we can exceed some target goal.  Brian, how much do you think it cost to build this feature?\n",
